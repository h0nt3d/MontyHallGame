A simple program written to simulate the Monty Hall Problem in a game.



The monty hall problem can be observed where we have 3 choices to make and 1 out of the 3 is the only correct choice. After making a first choice, we are then revealed a wrong choice out of the 3 choices and we are given a chance to change our choice or switch to the other.
